           from the south

           to the edge of the heavens;

              The first day of the week is named in honor of the Germanic–Norse sun goddess, Sol.
Driving the horses yoked to her chariot, she casts sparks of light across the world.
The children of Fenrir — the giant wolves Sköll and Hati — relentlessly pursue Sol and her brother Mani.
On the day of Ragnarök, the wolves will overtake the heavenly lights and devour them,
plunging sky and earth into darkness.

            The second day of the week is named after the Moon, the brother of the Sun — Mani.
Like his sister, he journeys across the sky in a chariot, governs the Moon and its phases,
and, like her, is fated to be devoured by the wolf Hati on the day of Ragnarök.

          <p class="ident">
            The third day of the week is named after Týr,
the Germanic–Norse god of war, victory, and honor.
The one-handed patron of warriors, he placed his right hand
into the jaws of Fenrir so that the wolf might be bound.
Thus, warriors carved his rune — shaped like an upward-pointing arrow —
upon their weapons.

From his throne in Asgard he gazes upon all,
seeing across the Nine Worlds,
knowing the fate of both the living and the dead.

              Thor, the son of Odin, is a valiant warrior and the defender of the worlds.
He journeys in his chariot drawn by goats, and by battling the jötnar and giants
he holds back the coming of Ragnarök.
The enchanted hammer he wields grants him dominion over thunder and storm.

             The sixth day of the week, Friday, is named after Freyja.
She is the goddess of love, desire, and the hearth.
Freyja has a husband, Óðr, who wanders endlessly through the worlds;
she mourns his absence, weeping tears of gold,
and then sets out in search of him across the earth.

             The final day of the week is named after Saturn,
the Roman god of time and fertility.
His symbols are the sickle and the black cube,
and his reign is associated with the Golden Age,
when the earth and rivers were fertile,
and humankind lived in harmony and equality.
